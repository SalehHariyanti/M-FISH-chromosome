M-FISH Chromosome Imaging dataset: 

1. The zipped file contains the entire M-FISH chromosome imaging database.

2. The pdf file is a copy of one of our papers using this database. 
(This is little old but it has some good information about the database). 

I hope this database is useful to you. If you obtain some interesting results 
and publish your work, please do cite the papers listed on the M-FISH webpage.
